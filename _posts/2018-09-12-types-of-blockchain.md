Once you decide that blockchain is the right solution, it's time to decide which type of blockchain would be most effective.

There are 3 types : **PUBLIC , PRIVATE, HYBRID**

Public blockchain = everyone has access  
                   anyone can join & access to add and verify transactions.  
                   ex) bitcoin

Private blockchain = It's opposite of public.  
                   It can restrict specific person.(assign permissions to specific users)  
                    It's like difference of internet and infranet.

Hybrid blockchain = It is hybrid of public and private blockchain.

**Though types are different, these use same encrypted data**  
You can see details in this websites. https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/05/the-difference-between-public-and-private-blockchain

Public and private **similarlity**  
•	Both are decentralized peer-to-peer networks, where each participant maintains a replica of a shared append-only ledger of digitally signed transactions.
•	Both maintain the replicas in sync through a protocol referred to as consensus.
•	Both provide certain guarantees on the immutability of the ledger, even when some participants are faulty or malicious.

**Cons**  
Public = It needs substantial amount of computational power. Why? It should maintain a distributed ledger at a large scale.  
To achieve consensus, each node in network must ensure(**proof of work**) all in sync.  
Private = They can join the party when they are invited. ex) hyperledger fabric
