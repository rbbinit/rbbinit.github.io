I talk about blockchain databases. For clear understanding, I want to compare traditional vs blockchain databases before.

As we know, traditional server has authority which control other all users.

Peer to peer indicates blockchain, Client server shows traditional databases.

Traditional data
network = centralized
functions = create, read, update, delete
mutability = mutable
authorization = centralized
transparency = low
  data is in center, and users need authentication from administrator(center)

Blockchain data
network = decentralized (**for consensus, must achieve majority**)
functions = read, append, validate **No delete **
mutability = immutable
authorization = no
transparency = high

But when traditional server decide that servers need to adjusted more, traditional server just add or delete them.
but P2P network cannot. (Because server itself is users(node) ) When users gone, server got hurt.

**For every situation, either of them is not best solution**
 There is no perfect database. So you should choose database type depending the situations.

Here is the questions you need to check. 
 Q1) You need database?
 Q2) Does it require shared write access?  (ex google spreadsheet)
 Q3) Will you need to create the trust between user? 
 Q4) Can you operate without trusted 3rd parties?
 Q5) Can you operate without control over permissions?
 
Here is also scenarios to help you decide which type of database you need.

Q1 ) Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) refers to voting using electronic means to either aid or take care of the chores of casting and counting votes. 
= Blockchain
Q2) Social network which depends on centralized control similar to Facebook.
= No Blockchain
