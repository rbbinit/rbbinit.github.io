I talk about network with comparison between P2p network and client-server model.

So, what is client-server model?

for example) **google, amazon, twitter** = keep their data stored across servers that they own

What is peer-to-peer network?

**disadvantages** : When larger miners keep buying more resources, the others only get a few nodes.

I want to compare with 5 characteristics

I want to check with the scenarios.  

Q1) Youâ€™d like to have control over the information of the database so that you can easily assign permissions to different users. Which model should you use?  
=C/S

Q2) You need a network that is very stable and you need control to either add or remove computation and storage depending on the clients. Which model should you use?  
= P2P

Q3) Security is important, but you do not want a central authority controlling permissions across the network. Which model should you use? 
= P2P

Q4) You want a model where decisions are made by nodes in the network as opposed to central entities. Which model should you use?  
= P2P

Q5) A large movie streaming site owns many servers to ensure if one of the servers fails, there are other servers on which to fall back on so the information is not lost.  
Which model does this describe?  
= C/S
