Types of wallet are Non-deterministic, Deterministic, Hierarchial Deterministic wallets.

*Definition

Non-deterministic wallet = A wallet where private keys are generated from random numbers.
Deterministic wallet = A wallet where addresses, private keys, and public keys can be traced back to their original seed words.
Hierarchical Deterministic wallet = It's advanced type of determinisitc wallet that contains keys derived in a tree structure.

Main diffrence between Non-determinisitic and deterministic is whether information is traced back from seed or not.
I mean, in deterministic wallet(HD wallet also), you can get information from the seed.
Because, seed generartes all the private keys. 

*HD = Hierarchical Deterministic wallet
HD is tree structure. Public master key produces children public key.

Knowing each types of wallets can user suit all the situations.

For each scenario, which types of wallets is best suited for? Here is the examples.

Q1 ) I want to create paper wallets derived from one master key so I can store and recover all of them deterministically. 
Which wallet is used to achieve this? 
= Sequential determinisitic 

Q2)  I’m creating a web server that sells widgets and want to generate an unique transaction address for every customer
and every address and track it independently. I want to be able to take a master public key and generate a sequence of sub-public keys, 
each associated with a transaction and put it on a public web server and make sure the web server has no private keys. 
= HD

Q3) A shoe supply chain is being audited. 
The auditors are given a public key so they can see all the transactions of the sub tree but they can’t unlock it. 
Which wallet is used to achieve this? 
= HD

Q4) A blockchain social media website uses private keys to secure personal user data. 
It uses wallets for backend services that use private keys that are not derived from a seed. 
Which wallet is used to achieve this?
= non-deterministic
