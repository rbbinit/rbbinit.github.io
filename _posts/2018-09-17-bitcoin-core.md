I want to introduce Bitcoin core! It has a development environment for the bitcoin blockchain.  
**Bitcoin Definition = Network of bitcoin users creating and validating transactions***  
**Bitcoin-core Definition = implementation of bitcoin that encompasses all of the software behind bitcoin***

You can see what you can do using bitcoin core.

So what is mainnet, testnet and regnet?  

***Mainnet = Primary network where live transactions take plac *** (live!)  
***Testnet = Test environment. It has no real world value. but peers exist on the network***  
***Regnet = Test environment, and no value at all. Peers doesn't exist on the network ***

We talk about mainnet vs testnet. Why chose one of them?  
There is difference between them.

***Purpose*** : Mainnet is for production. Testnet is for testing, literally.  
***Environment*** : Both of them are ***public***. It means that when you're using them, you'll interact with a network of ***peers***  
that create and validate information on the blockchain.  
***Value*** : Mainnet is for real-world value. In contrast, testnet is just for testing. So no value at all.  
***Public key prefix*** : Mainnet starts public key to "1" , Testnet's does "m or n"  

You can see details about testnet. https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Testnet

I use testnet rather than regnet. I post comparision of testnet and regnet on the next.
